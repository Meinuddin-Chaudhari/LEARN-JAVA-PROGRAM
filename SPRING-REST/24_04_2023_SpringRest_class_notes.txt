Distrubuted Applications
========================
 1. Using java we can develop several types of applications
	a. CUI and GUI based applications
	b. Web applications
	c. Distrubuted applications.

CUI and GUI based applications
==============================
 We prefer using J2SE module[CoreJava] of java to build these type of applications
  1. CUI => Character User Interface applications
		eg: Console based applications[Notepad,calculator,....]
  2. GUI => Graphical User Interface applications(Swings, Applets)
		eg: Eclipse,Zoom,MS-Office

If we build CUI/GUI applications every user should install these apps in their machine to use.
Standalone applications are specific to machine.

Web applications
================
 We prefer using JEE module(Servlet,JSP) and Spring MVC to build these type of applications

=> The applications which runs over the internet is called "webapplications".
=> These application no need to download and no need to install.
=> Anybody can access webapps from any location using browser with internet.
		eg: Gmail,Facebook,IRCTC etc,...
=> It uses client and server architecture.
=> client (browser) and in server computer we have project.
Note: Main theme is Customer - Buisness communication.

Distrubuted applications
=========================
   We prefer using WebServices and RestFulSevices to develop "Distrubuted applications".
=> The application which is communicating with other applications is called as "Distrubuted applications".
=> Distrubuted applications are meant for Buisness - Buisness communication.
		eg: browser=========> flipart============> paypal ===========> visa/Master/upi ============> SBI/ICICI
			    webapps	     distrubuted          distrubuted                  distrubuted

payment gateway => visa/master/upi provides world wide infrastructure to perform cards based transactions.
paypal -> It acts as a brigde between ecommerce site and payment gateway.
The cards issued by visa/master/upi will be given to customer through banks by linking with bank accounts.
	
=> We need Distrubuted applications becoz of reusing the buisness process.
	usecase 1: Ineuron company----to generate salary slip  -------> Excility global
	usecase 2: Ineuron company----to display weather forecast-----> IBM weather App
	usecase 3: Passport App -------> Adhar App


Technologies available to build Distrubuted applications are
  a. CORBA
  b. RMI
  c. EJB
  d. Webservices[Soap and XML]
  e. RESTFul services(RepresentationStatefull Services)[SpringReST]
